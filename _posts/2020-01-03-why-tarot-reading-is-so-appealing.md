According to a recent poll in Britain, one in four people have said they’ve consulted a psychic and it’s a similar-story in many other countries across the world. One branch of the psychic world which appears to be particularly popular is tarot reading.

If you’re one of the growing number of people thinking about having a tarot reading in the future then here’s some general information which may be of use to you.

Tarot reading is the act of telling the future or giving an insight into any situation using tarot cards. Individual tarot cards come in a tarot deck; each deck usually has seventy eight cards which comprises twenty two Major Arcana cards and fifty six Minor Arcana cards.

These Minor Arcana are in turn split into four suits which are swords, wands, pentacles and cups. As you can see, the tarot deck has strong similarities with an everyday pack of playing cards. Examples of Major Arcana cards are The Sun, Death and Justice whilst typical Minor Arcana cards are the Seven of Pentacles, the Two of Cups or the queen of Wands.

The way to tell the future through tarot is by interpreting the image of each card which appears in a reading. Each card also has traditional characteristics associated with it and in turn these can hold additional messages and guidance. For instance, the first card of the tarot pack is The Fool.

In the most widely-used tarot deck, the Rider-Waite deck, this card has the picture of a young man setting off on a journey. This young man however, is not looking where he’s going and is about to step off a cliff. A dog is by his side trying to warn him of this. The youthful man holds a rose in one hand and a small bundle of possessions attached to a stick in the other.

The overall card and the youthful character have a carefree feel to them. As such, it’s a card which symbolizes this carefree quality in addition to other things like optimism, hope and youthful energy. With The Fool being the first card of the tarot pack, it’s also associated with new beginnings.

If The Fool was drawn as a future card for your own tarot reading, it could therefore indicate this new beginning happening in your life at some point in the future. It may be you going on an actual journey or-possibly starting a new job or perhaps a new romance happening.

At the same time, it could be a warning about rushing into a situation you may later regret. If more information was needed, the tarot reader would naturally draw another card and in thisway a more detailed message and future prediction could be given.

You may be wondering just how the tarot cards appear to predict the future and how exactly does tarot work? The short answer to this is that no-one quite knows although everyone will have their own theories.

One line of thought is that guides, or angels, influence the tarot reader and the cards being drawn. It’s thought that these guides can in turn provide the insights of the tarot reader via the images on the cards. Other tarot readers would say it’s simply their psychic abilities which enable them to see the future with the aid and inspiration of the cards It’s these psychic powers, they would say, which also allow them to first pick the right cards and then interpret them correctly.
