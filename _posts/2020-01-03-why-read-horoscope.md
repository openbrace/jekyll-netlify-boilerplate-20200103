The ancient Greeks believed that a person’s life was predetermined and predictable by the positioning of the sun, moon and stars at the time of a person’s birth. They would use the positioning of the sun, moon and various constellations to predict the course a person’s life would take.

## Western Astrology

The ancient Greeks’ practice of predicting the future based on astrology, or horoscope reading, spread throughout the world and was “made acceptable” to people of persuasion in the -1600’s when greeks started calling it “Astrology.” 

Curiosity is probably the most prevalent human trait that has carried over from more primitive civilizations. Just as the ancient Greeks were curious about their future and general well being, so is modern society. Many people read their horoscopes daily in hopes of gaining some insight into their future as well as some much needed daily guidance. Some people turn to horoscopes for guidance when it conies to decision making.

## A person’s zodiac sign

Even though the messages offered in daily horoscopes tend to be vague and general, they can convey real meaning and guidance when applied to a specific situation. Others who may not be able to find the answers to the questions weighing most heavily on their minds may turn to horoscopes in hopes of being guided toward an answer.

Studies have shown that readers turn to horoscopes for answers most often with pressed with a burning question or difficult decision. Perhaps one of the most popular reasons someone reads their horoscope is to find out about their love life.

## Why Horoscope?

Why? What does anyone find contained within their horoscope? Here is the definition: “A horoscope is a chart or diagram representing the positions of the Sun, Moon, and the planets.” The astrologers chart the positions of the Sun, Moon and the Planets and how they are influencing each other. Using this information they predict what a person’s day will be like. Some days will be prosperous and others will be disastrous.

Some daily horoscopes predict that a person will lose their temper during the day and should avoid confrontations with anyone. Other horoscopes predict that the day will be very successful and they should invest their resources in certain places to earn great rewards. Each day will change for each person. Horoscopes are similar to a daily fortune teller predicting what kind of a day today will be.

Now let us analyze the question, “Why do people read horoscopes?” Why do people pray every day? Why do people go to their psychiatrist weekly? Why do people ask advice from anyone? Why do many people daily look for a “sign” which can give comfort or cause concern?
