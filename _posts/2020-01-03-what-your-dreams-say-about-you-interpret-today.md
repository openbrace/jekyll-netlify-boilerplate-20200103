  feelings and ideas. Some people remember more dreams than others but everyone
  Mc remembers a dream wants to know “What does this mean?” Tc answer this
  question, you don’t need to go to an expert or-consult a list of symbols you

Dreams have been puzzled over for centuries. In Homer’s Odyssey, Penelope has a dream of an eagle, interpreted as the return of her husband.

Greek thinkers such as Plato rejected the idea that dreams came from the gods, preferring the theory that while the body dept, the mind stayed awake. Herodotus, the Ancient Greek historian, said that dreams simply reflected the waking concerns of the dreamer.

But when dreams can seem so outlandish and illogical, how do they reflect your everyday concerns? Freud, who called dreams “the royal road to the unconscious”, believed that your mind is constantly dealing with thoughts, worries and ideas of which you’re never consciously aware. These forbidden and suppressed ideas make their way out in dreams when the conscious mind is sleeping and can’t control them. Dreams aren’t the voice of God, they are the voice of your unconscious mind, and the task of the analyst is to help interpret them.

But does dream interpretation really need a special gift from the gods or years of training as a psychoanalyst? Why can’t you just interpret your own dreams? This wish to understand what happens in your mind has resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of dream dictionaries

Have you had a dream about flying? Ask the dream dictionary what a flying dream means, Did you dream about being chased, or falling, or losing teeth? Check the dream dictionary The problem with dream dictionaries is that they give an explanation of dreams in general, but not of your specific experience.

They explain a dream, but not your dream. They work in much the same way as newspaper horoscopes. Wheth( or not you believe in astrology, two sentences in a newspaper column can’t possibly apply to every reader born during a given month. But they will be applicable to enough readers; the horoscope makes sense. So dream dictionaries make sense of dreams because their interpretations are broadly applicable.

The best way to understand your own dreams isn’t to look up each element in a dream dictionary. It’s to know how information is presented in dreams so that you can decode it yourself.

Firstly, and most importantly, whatever you remember about your dream isn’t accurate. As soon as your conscious mind begins to process the dream, it changes. You’ve experienced this if you’ve ever tried to tell another person about your dream. What seemed like a coherent narrative suddenly seems to be a series of disjointed moments, and pretty soon what you remember is Mat you said aloud, and the original dream has vanished for-ever.

Secondly, dreams do include symbols, but not always in the way they are presented in dream dictionaries, In many cases, a symbol in a dream is a simple visual reference: a worry about the health of your bowels might result in a dream about a blocked drain. And symbols aren’t only visual. Dreams often involve puns, or similar sounding words A person who is worried about making a “right” decision may dream about a maze where they are compelled t( turn right.

Thirdly, dreams are more often about feelings than events, Many dreams take place in familiar surroundings or feature people known to the dreamer in an unfamiliar setting. In most cases, the dream is about neither the place nor the person, but about the feelings associated with that person and place.

This is the reason that dream dictionaries aren’t always useful. If you dream about your cousin, a list of symbols can’t possibly know how you feel about that person, and that’s what’s important in understanding the dream.

The dream is about you. There are oft-quoted examples of “prophetic” dreams, where a future event is revealed, but these are few and far between, and may involve the dream being interpreted in hindsight. For the purposes of interpreting your own dreams, it’s best to assume that whatever happens in the dream i s what’s happening in your own mind. If you dream about your cousin, the dream is about the part of you that loves or hates or-is most similar to that person, and not actually about your-cousin at all.

How can you use these principles to understand your dreams? The first step is to keep a record of your dream. You can write down Mat you remember, or record yourself talking about it. Although most smart phones have the facility to record your voice, by the time you’ve unlocked your phone and navigated through the menu, your conscious mind will have censored most of the dream.

An old-fashioned dicta phone works best, where you simply have to hold down the “record” button and speak. Say whatever you can remember about your dream. Include as much detail as you can, particularly about your feelings.

Thanks for reading.
