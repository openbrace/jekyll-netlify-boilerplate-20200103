  The field of astrology is a fascinating one, and there are many things to
  learn about this ancient art. The astrological world places great importance
  on a number of natural elements, including the moon, the stars and
  other-heavenly bodies, but the sun is of course one of the most important
  elements in the world of astrology.


  To those who study astrology, the sun is seen to represent the personality of
  the individual born under its influence. The sun is also thought to exert
  influence over those interests, traits and issues that empower individuals and
  help them live their lives more fully.

There are many ways to explore the world of astrology, from very simple methods to ones that are quite complex. Some individuals will simply be content to read the horoscope for their sun sign a couple of times a year, while others will seek to gain a deeper understanding of their personality and the personality of others who share the month and day of their birth.

Those who wish to delve more deeply into the world of astrology have a number of choices, from old fashioned techniques like leaming the art at the feet of an old master to new methods that use unique computer programs tc determine the exact position of any number of heavenly bodies at the time of one’s birth.

Sun signs provide an important glimpse into an individual’s true identity, as well as their purpose and their destiny.
